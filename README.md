# Before getting started.

- You need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/) installed.   
- Replace the `.env.example` file by a `.env` file and fill the `TOKEN_SECRET` var


# Play with the server

- `yarn start`   
- You'll find the playground to play around with the GraphQL queries and mutations at `localhost:3000/graphql`
- If it's the first time you see an Apollo playground, [here's some documentation](https://blog.logrocket.com/complete-guide-to-graphql-playground/)   
- This small project was developped for tutorial purposes, if you want to know more about it, [click here](https://steeve-aubert.medium.com/graphql-node-js-mongodb-set-up-a-basic-server-with-user-model-and-auth-d05ed4d5a864)
